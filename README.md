# LEOS
LEOS is a trust infrastructure that makes honesty economically rational at scale. It records only voluntary obligations—contracts, services, deliveries—linking promises to outcomes. Verified events carry reputational weight with a real cost to attest, making forgery expensive. Trust becomes portable across markets while privacy stays protected.
